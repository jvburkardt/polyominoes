<em>polyominoes</em> is a collection of MATLAB codes which uses linear programming techniques to tile a given target region 
with a finite collection of polyominoes. Very small problems can be solved using the row reduced echelon form of the linear
system. In general, however, an integer programming package, such as CPLEX, GUROBI, or SCIP, must be invoked to obtain
solutions which are binary (only 0 or 1). The collection of MATLAB codes here supports the first two papers cited in the 
references below.

<em>polyominoes</em> is available here in a MATLAB version.
